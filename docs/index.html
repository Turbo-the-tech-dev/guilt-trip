        <p><em>A project exploring the concept of "guilt-trip."</em></p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The `guilt-trip` project is currently a blank slate, but its name suggests an exploration into psychological or emotional themes related to guilt. This could manifest as a creative writing project, a game, a psychological experiment, or a data analysis project.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <p>As a new project, `guilt-trip` is currently undefined. The initial focus is on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the core objective and what "guilt-trip" signifies within this project.</li>
            <li>Brainstorming potential features or forms the project might take.</li>
            <li>Considering the target audience and desired impact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of guilt-trip</h2>
        <p>The future of `guilt-trip` will be shaped by its core definition. Potential future directions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing interactive narratives or simulations.</li>
            <li>Collecting and analyzing data related to emotional responses.</li>
            <li>Creating artistic expressions inspired by the concept.</li>
            <li>Building tools to understand or navigate social dynamics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project's progress and direction will be tracked through the issues in this repository.</p>
